Julia Kelley is the Lab Manager for the DPDM genomics laboratory in the Malaria branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  She developed an interest in research and public health after interning for two summers at the CDC. She joined the Malaria branch through the Atlanta Research and Education Foundation in May 2015. She currently performs the sample QC, library preparations and next generation sequencing for the Malaria Branch for a number of project.  

Born and raised in Marietta, Georgia, Julia has lived in the Atlanta area all her life. She studied biology at Kennesaw State University while playing for the Division I women’s soccer team on a four-year athletic scholarship.  She is currently studying at the University of South Florida for her MPH in Epidemiology, and plans to graduate in summer 2019.  When she isn’t in the lab, you can find Julia trying out the tastiest places for steak in Atlanta, playing chase with her dog, Loki, and traveling. She is also an avid Liverpool and Atlanta United fan.
